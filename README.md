## Fundamentals of Javascript Exercises
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/fundamentals-part-4) >> [Relevant repository](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/javascript-exercises)

I did not check the solutions for these exercises, but all of my solutions pass each of their associated tests.

Completed throughout the day, but once completed they were pushed individually to practice working with git.

The following exercises were part of the main cirriculum:

* helloWorld
* repeatString
* reverseString
* removeFromArray
* sumAll
* leapYears
* tempConversion

The rest of the files were part of the full repo and I did my best to complete them. All but one (the snakeCase exercise) passed all of their tests. Where the snakeCase exercise is concerned, all but one of the tests was passed. I'll be happy to come back and try to pass the last test when I have some more experience with regex.
